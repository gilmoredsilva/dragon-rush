# Elemental Platformer Game (Unity)

A 2D platformer game where the player controls a small red humanoid dragon with **five elemental powers**.  
Each element has unique interactions with the environment, enemies, and obstacles, designed to encourage puzzle-like gameplay and exploration.

This repository is uploaded as a project showcase for **GDG On Campus selection** and my game development learning journey.

##  Game Concept
The player progresses through levels filled with traps and enemies, using elemental abilities to overcome obstacles and unlock paths.

The core gameplay is built around:
- **movement + platforming precision**
- **element-based interaction puzzles**
- **combat against melee/ranged enemies**
- **progression through increasingly complex challenges**

###  Pyro (Fire)

- Interacts with environmental hazards

###  Electro (Electric)

- `/Obj`
